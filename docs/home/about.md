# About This Course

## Course Designer

These course materials have been designed and developed by **Avgi Stavrou**, as part of AmaDema's commitment to upskilling its R&D workforce in AI technologies whilst maintaining the highest standards of intellectual property protection and environmental responsibility.

## Training Philosophy

This programme differs from generic AI training in three fundamental ways:

### 1. Materials Science Focus

Every example, exercise, and framework application is tailored to the specific needs of materials scientists and nanotechnology researchers. You won't find generic "write an email" prompts here—instead, you'll learn to:

- Extract polymer synthesis parameters from literature
- Analyse tensile testing data for non-oxide ceramics
- Generate structured reports for IP legal teams
- Automate SEM image analysis workflows

### 2. Security-First Approach

We operate under the principle that **access to AI tools does not require data exposure**. You'll learn to:

- Identify the "Red List" of data that must never be uploaded
- Sanitise datasets before external processing
- Use local, air-gapped models for sensitive work
- Balance utility with security

### 3. Environmental Consciousness

AI is not free—computationally or environmentally. This course treats **Green AI** as a core operational requirement, not an optional consideration. You'll understand the carbon cost of your queries and learn to optimise for both quality and sustainability.

## Teaching Materials & Deliverables

This course includes comprehensive support materials for long-term adoption:

### 📘 The Prompt Engineering Cheat Sheet

A "book of spells" for the R&D team, containing:

- Visual templates for AUTOMAT and CO-STAR frameworks
- Pre-tested "Golden Prompts" for common lab tasks
- The "Red List" for data security
- Quick reference for model selection

### 🔬 Interactive Nano-Sandbox

A secure, local instance of Llama 3.3 8B that allows you to:

- Practice with real, sensitive data during the workshop
- Experiment in a completely offline environment
- Eliminate IP risk whilst learning
- Test prompts without external data exposure

### 💻 Practical Exercises

Highly interactive sessions including:

- **The Hallucination Hunt**: Audit an AI-generated chemical report to find deliberate errors
- **Green Optimisation Challenge**: Refactor inefficient prompt chains into lean instructions
- **Real Data Processing**: Work with actual tensile test data and SEM images
- **Prompt Peer Review**: Evaluate and improve colleague's prompts

### 📦 Take-Home Resources

- GitHub repository with all course materials
- Downloadable PDFs of frameworks and cheat sheets
- Template prompts for common R&D tasks
- Setup guides for local model deployment

## Use of AI in Course Development

In alignment with our institutional principles of transparency, the following AI tools were used in the development of these materials:

- **Claude (Sonnet 4)** – Content structuring, framework adaptation to materials science context
- **ChatGPT (GPT-4)** – Generation of synthetic datasets for exercises
- **Microsoft Copilot** – Document formatting and quality assurance

All technical content has been independently verified, and AI-generated examples have been validated against materials science best practices.
