# Summary

You should now be able to:

- Get reliable outputs via **structured prompting** (CCF, AUTOMAT, CO-STAR)
- Protect IP with a clear **red list** and sanitisation habits
- Use **MCP** patterns to connect models to tools (and keep a human safety gate)
- Reduce cost/energy with **Green AI** defaults (smaller models, fewer tokens, reuse templates)

Next: convert your highest-value prompts into versioned templates and treat them like code.
