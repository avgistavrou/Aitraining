# Course Summary

Congratulations on completing the AmaDema AI Training Programme! Let's consolidate your learning and plan next steps.

## Key Takeaways

### 1. Prompt Engineering is a Skill

**You've learned:**

✅ **AUTOMAT Framework** for functional, structured tasks  
✅ **CO-STAR Framework** for strategic, narrative communication  
✅ **How to** reduce iterations from 5-6 to 1-2 with upfront specification  
✅ **Why** frameworks matter: consistency, reproducibility, efficiency

**Impact:** 70-80% reduction in time to useful output

---

### 2. Security First

**You've learned:**

✅ **The Red List** - data types never to share with public AI  
✅ **Sanitisation techniques** - anonymise, aggregate, hypothetical framing  
✅ **Local sandbox** - complete privacy for sensitive work  
✅ **Decision framework** - when to use which tool

**Impact:** Zero IP leakage whilst leveraging AI power

---

### 3. Understanding Limitations

**You've learned:**

✅ **Hallucinations** - why they occur and how to prevent  
✅ **Verification protocols** - never trust without checking  
✅ **Boundary conditions** - when AI fails  
✅ **Pattern matching** - AI doesn't "understand," it predicts

**Impact:** Critical evaluation skills prevent costly mistakes

---

### 4. Environmental Responsibility

**You've learned:**

✅ **Carbon footprint** - every query has environmental cost  
✅ **Optimization strategies** - batch, cache, choose right model  
✅ **NLM vs LLM** - use smallest tool that works  
✅ **Green AI practices** - 80-90% reduction possible

**Impact:** Same quality output, 10× less environmental footprint

---

### 5. Strategic Tool Selection

**You've learned:**

✅ **NLMs** for extraction, classification (fast, efficient)  
✅ **Small LLMs** (8B) for routine tasks  
✅ **Medium LLMs** (70B) for complex analysis  
✅ **Large LLMs** (GPT-4) for critical reasoning  
✅ **Local models** for sensitive data

**Impact:** Right tool for each job = efficiency + quality

---

### 6. Conversational Learning

**You've learned:**

✅ **"Why" questions** - understand principles, not just instructions  
✅ **Challenge AI** - test reasoning, find boundaries  
✅ **Transfer knowledge** - apply frameworks across contexts  
✅ **Socratic dialogue** - guide yourself to insights

**Impact:** Build expertise, not just get answers

---

## Your Transformation

### Before This Training

**Typical interaction:**
```
"Summarise this paper"
[Generic summary]
"Thanks"
```

**Result:**
- 5-6 iterations to useful output
- Generic, unfocused results
- No learning occurred
- Potential IP leakage
- High environmental cost

---

### After This Training

**Optimized interaction:**
```
[AUTOMAT-structured prompt with persona, task, output format, 
constraints, tone]
[High-quality, targeted output on first attempt]
[Verify critical claims]
[Cache for future use]
```

**Result:**
- 1-2 iterations to production-ready output
- Precise, structured, reproducible results
- Understanding of methodology gained
- IP protected
- 80% less environmental impact
