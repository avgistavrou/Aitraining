## General Questions

### What if I'm not comfortable sharing certain data even in the sandbox?

**Answer:** That's perfectly valid! The sandbox is for practice - you can always use:

- Hypothetical examples
- Sanitized/anonymized data
- Generic placeholders (e.g., "Polymer A", "[TEMP]°C")

The Red List protocol applies everywhere, including the sandbox, even though it's secure.

### Can I use the frameworks (AUTOMAT/CO-STAR) with tools other than ChatGPT?

**Answer:** Absolutely! These frameworks work with any LLM:

- Claude, Gemini, Copilot
- Local models (Llama, Mistral)
- Even specialized models (code assistants, research tools)

The principles are universal, clear structure, explicit constraints, defined outputs.

## Technical Questions

### Why does the sandbox model respond slower than ChatGPT?

**Answer:** Two main reasons:

1. **CPU vs GPU:** ChatGPT runs on powerful GPUs; our sandbox uses CPU (slower but private)
2. **Model size:** We use 3B parameters (fast, efficient) vs. ChatGPT's larger models

Trade-off: Privacy vs. speed. For training purposes, 3-8 second responses are fine!

## Framework Questions

---

### What if my prompt doesn't work even with frameworks?

**Troubleshooting checklist:**

1. Is output format specified exactly? (table columns, bullet structure, etc.)
2. Are constraints explicit? ("If missing, mark 'NR'" not just "summarize")
3. Is the task clear? (avoid "help me with X" - be specific)
4. Is context relevant? (remove unnecessary background)
5. Is model capable? (use LLM for reasoning, NLM for extraction)

Post your prompt in AMA for personalized feedback!

## Red List & Security

### What if I accidentally shared something from the Red List?

**Immediate steps:**

1. Stop using that conversation/session
2. Notify your supervisor
3. Document what was shared
4. Follow company incident response

**Prevention:** When in doubt, use sandbox or don't share at all.

## Application Questions

### Can I use these techniques for non-materials-science work?

**Answer:** Yes! The frameworks are domain-agnostic:

- AUTOMAT works for any structured task
- CO-STAR works for any strategic communication
- Red List applies to any company data
- Green AI applies to any usage

Just adapt examples to your domain.
