- Sandbox vs. external tools

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Prompt Engineering is Not About "Talking Nicely to AI"

It's about:
- Precision specification (like experimental protocols)
- Explicit constraints (like defining experimental boundaries)
- Structured frameworks (like the scientific method)

---

### 2. AUTOMAT = The Scientific Method for AI

| Scientific Method | AUTOMAT Framework |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Define hypothesis | Task |
| Design experiment | Method |
| Specify measurements | Output |
| Control variables | Assumptions |
| Document rigorously | Tone + Audience |

---

### 3. Conversational Learning > Task Completion

**Don't ask:** "What's the best solvent for PLA?"  
**Ask:** "Why is DMF preferred? What are the trade-offs? When would alternatives be better?"

**Outcome:** Transferable decision framework, not just a single answer

---

### 4. IP Security is Non-Negotiable

**Red List items NEVER go to external AI:**
- Unpublished data
- Patent-pending processes
- Customer information
- Financial details
- Proprietary formulations

**Use the sandbox for sensitive work!**

---

## What You'll Build Today

### Template Library (Started)

By end of Day 1, you'll have:
- Literature data extraction template
- Lab notebook formatting template
- Risk assessment checklist
- First conversational learning scripts

---

### Real Efficiency Gains

**Traditional approach:**
- Literature review: 4-6 hours
- Protocol formatting: 20-30 min per protocol
- Multiple iterations to get format right

**With AUTOMAT:**
- Literature review: 1-1.5 hours (75% reduction)
- Protocol formatting: 3-5 min per protocol (85% reduction)
- First-shot success rate >70%

---

## Today's Exercises

You'll practice with:

1. **Literature Data Extraction** (AUTOMAT)
   - Extract synthesis parameters from 8 papers
   - Structured output for competitive analysis
   
2. **Hallucination Hunt**
   - Find 5 deliberate errors in an AI-generated report
   - Learn verification techniques

3. **Red List Assessment**
   - Evaluate 5 scenarios for IP risk
   - Practice sanitisation strategies

4. **Prompt Refinement Challenge**
   - Transform a vague prompt into high-quality AUTOMAT prompt
   - A/B test in sandbox

---

## Materials You'll Use

- **Sandbox environment:** `http://[instructor-IP]:3000`
- **Model:** Llama 3.2 (3B) - running locally, 100% private
- **Red List Protocol:** [Reference guide](../resources/red-list.md)
- **Cheat Sheet:** [Quick reference](../resources/cheat-sheet.md)

---

## Success Criteria

**You're ready for Day 2 when you can:**

✅ Explain why structured prompts outperform casual requests  
✅ Write a complete AUTOMAT prompt for a functional task  
✅ Identify Red List violations in scenarios  
✅ Use "why" questions to build learning dialogues  
✅ Navigate the sandbox confidently

---

## Common Questions

### "Isn't this overkill for simple tasks?"

For one-sentence tasks, yes. But most R&D work isn't simple. Frameworks:
- Ensure reproducibility
- Reduce iteration time
- Create reusable templates
- Protect against hallucinations

### "How long until this feels natural?"

**Week 1:** Frameworks feel mechanical (checking cheat sheet frequently)  
**Month 1:** Frameworks become intuitive (70% first-shot success)  
**Month 3:** You're building template libraries (5-10 hrs/week saved)

### "Can I use ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini for this?"

**For public information:** Yes (literature, published methods)  
**For sensitive work:** No - use the sandbox

Always check the Red List first!

## Pre-Work (If Available)

**Recommended reading before the session:**

- [What are LLMs?](../fundamentals/what-are-llms.md)
- [LLM Tools Comparison](../fundamentals/llm-tools.md)
- [Context Matters](../fundamentals/context-matters.md)

**Time:** 15-20 minutes

**Note:** Not required, but provides helpful background

---

## Looking Ahead

**Day 2** will build on today's foundation:
- CO-STAR framework (for strategic communication)
- Context deep dive (why it's critical)
- Advanced hallucination detection

**Day 3-4** will cover:
- Technical architecture (how LLMs actually work)
- Green AI (environmental impact & optimization)
- Ethics, bias, and responsible deployment
