## Key Facts

🔥 **Training GPT-3:** 85,000 kg CO₂ (equivalent to 112 cars for a year)

💧 **ChatGPT usage:** ~0.5 litres fresh water per 20-50 prompts

⚡ **Data centres:** ~40% of energy goes to cooling

🌍 **Water scarcity:** 2/3 of new US data centres (since 2022) in water-scarce areas

---

## Your Impact

**Every query you make requires:**
- Computational resources (energy)
- Data centre cooling (water)
- Carbon emissions (electricity generation)

**Annual impact** for typical researcher:
- ~5,000 queries/year
- ~125 kg CO₂/year (equivalent to 800 km driving)
- ~250 litres water/year

## Sustainable Practices

### Reduce Usage

✅ Batch similar queries together  
✅ Use AI for high-value tasks, not trivial ones  
✅ Cache and reuse outputs  
✅ Think before you prompt

### Choose Efficiently

✅ Consider computational cost  
✅ Avoid unnecessary regeneration  
✅ Choose smaller models when appropriate  
✅ Select providers with renewable energy commitments

### Acknowledge the Option

✅ It's valid to limit or avoid AI use based on environmental concerns  
✅ Alternative approaches may be more sustainable  
✅ Value in knowing how AI works without necessarily using it
