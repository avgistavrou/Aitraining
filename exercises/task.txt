1. For tensile tests, the input is 7 sets of time vs load data. The ideal output is filtered stress strain data in an excel file and then the average tensile strength and Young's modulus of the seven samples with the standard deviation. Detect outliers based on a threshold set by the user.
2. For SEM images we usually manually measure diameters from 20 representative fibers using Image-J. The input will be the .tif SEM photos and output the average fiber diameter and standard deviation of the 20 measurements and the material's porosity. Fiber diameter is the distance from A to B on the SEM photo using the scale available at the bottom. Porosity is the percent of area that is not covered by fibers.
