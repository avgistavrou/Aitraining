## SLIDE 5: Section Title - Introduction to Prompt Engineering

**Visual:**
- Bold section divider
- Minimalist design

**Content:**
```
PART 1

Introduction to
Prompt Engineering

Why it matters for materials scientists
```

**Design Notes:**
- Full-slide text, centered
- "PART 1" small at top in red
- Main title in large black text
- Subtitle in gray
- Red accent line at bottom

**Speaker Notes:**
> First, let's establish why you're here. Prompt engineering isn't about being polite to AI or using magic words. It's a systematic skill - like experimental design - that separates amateur AI users from professionals.

---

## SLIDE 6: What is Prompt Engineering?

**Visual:**
- Split slide: Definition left, Example right
- Icon: Precision tool (caliper or micrometer)

**Content:**
```
What is Prompt Engineering?

Definition:
The practice of designing inputs (prompts) 
to get specific, high-quality outputs from 
AI models

For Materials Scientists:
The skill of transforming vague requests 
into precise instructions that yield 
scientifically rigorous results

Think of it as: The experimental design 
of AI interactions
```

**Design Notes:**
- Left side: Text
- Right side: Visual comparison (vague → precise)
- Red arrow showing transformation

**Speaker Notes:**
> Simple definition: prompt engineering is designing inputs to get quality outputs. For us as materials scientists, it's about transforming "help me with this paper" into structured requests that yield publication-ready analysis. You already know how to design experiments precisely - prompt engineering uses the same thinking applied to AI interactions.

**Interactive Element:**
> **Quick Poll:** "How many of you currently spend more than 3 attempts to get a useful AI output?" (Show of hands)

---

## SLIDE 7: The Problem We're Solving

**Visual:**
- Two-column comparison: Casual vs Professional
- Red X on left, green checkmark on right

**Content:**
```
Casual AI Use (Inefficient)              Professional AI Use (Efficient)

User: "Summarize this paper"        →   [AUTOMAT structured prompt]
AI: Generic summary                     
User: "I need parameters"            →   First-shot success
AI: Inconsistent format                  • Precise output
User: "Make it a table"              →   • Correct format
AI: Missing columns                      • Complete data
User: "Add temp/pressure"            →   • Ready to use
AI: Mixed units
User: "Consistent units"
... 5 more iterations

Time: 20 minutes                         Time: 3 minutes
Quality: Mediocre                        Quality: Publication-ready
Reproducible: No                         Reproducible: Yes (templated)
```

**Design Notes:**
- Left column in gray/red showing chaos
- Right column in black/green showing efficiency
- Arrows showing workflow

**Speaker Notes:**
> Here's the problem. On the left, typical casual use - vague request, generic output, multiple iterations, wasted time. You eventually get something usable but it took 20 minutes and you can't reproduce it tomorrow. On the right, professional approach using frameworks you'll learn today - precise request, first-shot success, 3 minutes, reproducible. Same quality or better in 15% of the time.

**Interactive Element:**
> **Think-Pair-Share:** "Turn to the person next to you. Describe one AI task where you've had this left-side experience - multiple iterations to get what you needed." (2 minutes)

---

## SLIDE 8: Why This Matters for R&D

**Visual:**
- Impact metrics with icons
- Bar chart showing time savings

**Content:**
```
Efficiency Gains (Real Data)

Before Prompt Engineering:
• Literature review: 8 hours
• Protocol formatting: 30 min/protocol
• Experimental brainstorming: 2 hours

After Prompt Engineering:
• Literature review: 2 hours (75% ↓)
• Protocol formatting: 5 min (83% ↓)
• Experimental brainstorming: 30 min (75% ↓)

Quality: Same or better
Reproducibility: Template-based
Time savings: 5-10 hours/week
```

**Design Notes:**
- Before/after bars in gray vs red
- Large percentage reductions highlighted
- Clock icon showing time saved

**Speaker Notes:**
> These aren't hypothetical numbers. This is from materials scientists who've completed this training. Literature reviews drop from full day to half day. Protocol formatting becomes 5 minutes instead of 30. You're not sacrificing quality - often it improves because you're being more systematic. Template-based approach means you can share with colleagues and everyone benefits.

**Interactive Element:**
> **Discussion Prompt:** "Which of these tasks takes you the most time currently?" (Quick responses)

---

## SLIDE 9: Quality Improvements

**Visual:**
- Checklist with examples
- Icons for each benefit

**Content:**
```
Beyond Speed: Quality Benefits

✓ Consistent Output Format
  No more reformatting AI responses

✓ Fewer Hallucinations
  Explicit constraints prevent guessing

✓ Verifiable Results
  Cite sources, show calculations

✓ Suitable for Professional Use
  Publication, patents, reports

✓ Reproducible Workflows
  Templates for recurring tasks
```

**Design Notes:**
- Each benefit with icon and example
- Red checkmarks
- Clean, spaced layout

**Speaker Notes:**
> Speed is nice, but quality matters more. Structured prompts lead to consistent formats - no more copying AI output into Excel because it gave you prose instead of a table. Explicit constraints reduce hallucinations - you tell AI "if data is missing, mark NR, don't estimate." You get verifiable, professionally usable outputs. And templates mean your colleague can use your proven prompt and get similar results.

## SLIDE 10: The Learning Journey

**Visual:**
- Timeline/progression graphic
- Icons showing skill development stages

**Content:**
```
Your Skill Development Path

Week 1: Mechanical Application
Prompts feel structured but mechanical
Checking cheat sheet frequently
→ Normal!

Month 1: Natural Integration
Frameworks become intuitive
70% first-shot success rate
→ Achievement unlocked

Month 3: Template Building
10-20 templates for common tasks
Colleagues asking for your prompts
→ Time savings: 5-10 hrs/week

Month 6: Teaching Others

```

**Design Notes:**
- Ascending staircase or mountain climb visual
- Each stage as a platform with milestone
- Red progress line

**Speaker Notes:**
> This is your realistic progression. Week 1 feels mechanical - you'll reference the cheat sheet constantly. That's expected. By month 1, it clicks - you're thinking in frameworks naturally. Month 3, you've built a template library and colleagues notice your efficiency. Month 6, you're the go-to expert. This isn't instant mastery; it's systematic skill development. But the compound returns are remarkable.

## SLIDE 11: Section Title - AUTOMAT Framework

**Visual:**
- Bold section divider with framework name
- Minimalist design

**Content:**
```
PART 2

The AUTOMAT Framework

Your systematic method for scientific prompts
```

**Design Notes:**
- "AUTOMAT" in large red letters
- Subtitle in black
- Red accent line

**Speaker Notes:**
> Now let's learn your first framework. AUTOMAT is designed for functional tasks - data extraction, formatting, analysis. Think of it as your experimental protocol template, but for AI prompts.

---

## SLIDE 12: AUTOMAT Components

**Visual:**
- Acronym breakdown with icons
- Vertical list with clear spacing

**Content:**
```
A - Audience (Who will read/use this?)
U - User Persona (Who is AI acting as?)
T - Task (What specific action required?)
O - Output (What format/structure?)
M - Method (How to approach?)
A - Assumptions (What constraints apply?)
T - Tone (What voice/style?)

Seven components = Complete specification
```

**Design Notes:**
- Each letter in red box
- Component name in black
- Brief description in gray
- Icons for each component:
  - A: People icon
  - U: Profile icon
  - T: Target icon
  - O: Document icon
  - M: Process icon
  - A: Lock icon
  - T: Speech bubble icon

**Speaker Notes:**
> AUTOMAT - seven components that ensure complete prompt specification. Audience defines who reads the output (affects technical depth). User Persona tells AI what expertise to apply. Task is the specific action. Output defines exact format. Method guides approach. Assumptions set constraints and boundaries. Tone sets voice. Together, these seven components eliminate ambiguity and enable first-shot success.

**Interactive Element:**
> **Quick Check:** "Which component do you think gets forgotten most often?" (Collect guesses)

---

## SLIDE 13: A - Audience

**Visual:**
- Different audience types illustrated
- Impact diagram

**Content:**
```
A - Audience
Define who will consume this output

Affects:
• Technical depth
• Terminology level
• Required disclaimers
• Level of detail

Examples:
→ IP Legal Team: Formal, cite sources, flag novelty
→ R&D Colleagues: Technical, assume domain knowledge
→ Management: High-level, business impact focus
→ External Partners: Balanced, avoid proprietary info
```

**Design Notes:**
- Four audience types with icons
- Arrows showing how audience affects output
- Example boxes in light gray

**Speaker Notes:**
> Audience shapes everything. Writing for lawyers vs engineers vs management requires different approaches. Lawyers need citations and formality. Engineers want technical depth. Management wants business implications. External partners need balanced detail without proprietary information. Same data, different packaging. Specifying audience upfront prevents wasted iterations reformatting for the wrong reader.

---

## SLIDE 14: U - User Persona

**Visual:**
- Example personas with expertise badges
- Before/after comparison

**Content:**
```
U - User Persona
Define AI's role and expertise

Why it matters:
Without persona → "Helpful generalist" (too broad)
With persona → Domain expert (targeted depth)

Examples for Materials Science:
"Act as a Senior Polymer Chemist with expertise 
in electrospinning"

"Act as a Materials Science Patent Analyst"

"Act as a Laboratory Safety Officer reviewing protocols"

"Act as a Data Scientist specializing in mechanical 
testing analysis"
```

**Design Notes:**
- Example personas in separate boxes
- "Before/after" comparison showing generic vs expert response

**Speaker Notes:**
> User Persona activates specific knowledge domains. Without it, AI defaults to "helpful generalist" - too broad for scientific work. With it, you get targeted expertise. "Act as Senior Polymer Chemist" brings polymer-specific knowledge, electrospinning context, materials science terminology. This isn't role-play; it's activating relevant training data patterns. Specificity matters - "Senior Polymer Chemist with electrospinning expertise" beats "materials scientist."

---

## SLIDE 15: T - Task

**Visual:**
- Bad example with red X
- Good example with green checkmark

**Content:**
```
T - Task
Specify the precise action required

❌ Vague:
"Summarize this paper"
"Analyze this data"
"Help me with synthesis"

✅ Explicit:
"Extract synthesis parameters from Section 3.2"
"Calculate tensile strength and Young's modulus from 
these 7 stress-strain curves, excluding outliers >2 SD"
"Propose 5 alternative synthesis routes that avoid 
toxic solvents"
```

**Design Notes:**
- Side-by-side comparison
- Red X and green checkmark prominent
- Highlighting specific verbs (extract, calculate, propose)

**Speaker Notes:**
> Task is where most prompts fail. "Summarize this paper" - summarize what? Key findings? Methods? All sections? Ambiguity forces AI to guess. "Extract synthesis parameters from Section 3.2" - explicit, actionable, no guessing required. Every vague task leads to iteration. Every explicit task increases first-shot success. Use specific verbs: extract, calculate, compare, propose, format, identify. Avoid: summarize, analyze, help (too vague).

**Interactive Element:**
> **Live Demo:** Show a vague prompt getting poor results, then show AUTOMAT prompt with T component getting first-shot success. (Use sandbox live)

---

## SLIDE 16: O - Output

**Visual:**
- Format examples shown visually
- Template preview

**Content:**
```
O - Output
Define exact format and structure

Common Scientific Formats:
• Markdown table with specified columns
• CSV data with headers
• JSON structure
• Bullet points with citations
• Structured report (sections defined)
• Python code (commented)

Example Specification:
"Output: Markdown table with columns:
- Polymer Type
- Synthesis Temperature (°C)
- Yield (%)
- Source (DOI)

Sort by: Yield (descending)
Include: 10-15 entries"
```

**Design Notes:**
- Visual examples of each format (small previews)
- Detailed specification in highlighted box

**Speaker Notes:**
> Output specification prevents reformatting iterations. Don't say "put it in a table" - specify columns, sorting, how many entries. Don't say "give me code" - specify language, commenting style, function structure. This component alone can save 3-4 iterations. AI doesn't know what format you need; you must tell it explicitly. Include units, column names, sorting criteria, number of items, everything that defines "correct format" for your use.

---

## SLIDE 17: M - Method

**Visual:**
- Process flow diagram
- Standards/methodology icons

**Content:**
```
M - Method
Specify approach or methodology

Examples for Materials Science:

"Use systematic literature review principles"

"Apply ISO 527 tensile testing standards"

"Follow IUPAC nomenclature"

"Compare results against baseline (pure PLA)"

"Calculate statistics using standard error of the mean"

"Use linear regression for modulus (strain 0.05-0.25%)"
```

**Design Notes:**
- Each example in a box with relevant icon
- Arrow showing method → process → output

**Speaker Notes:**
> Method guides how AI approaches the task. "Use ISO 527 standards" invokes specific testing methodology. "Follow IUPAC nomenclature" ensures correct chemical naming. "Compare against pure PLA baseline" provides reference point. Method is especially important for technical work where specific standards or conventions apply. If you have a preferred methodology, specify it. If there are multiple valid approaches, specifying method prevents AI from choosing arbitrarily.

---

## SLIDE 18: A - Assumptions (Constraints)

**Visual:**
- Constraint types with examples
- Boundary diagram

**Content:**
```
A - Assumptions & Constraints
Critical for scientific accuracy

Three Types:

1. Whitelist (What to Include)
   "Focus exclusively on non-oxide ceramics"
   "Only papers published 2020-2024"

2. Blacklist (What to Exclude)
   "Exclude review papers"
   "Ignore pre-2020 publications"

3. Uncertainty Handling
   "If data missing, mark 'Not Reported' - do not estimate"
   "If conflicting values, flag discrepancy"
   "Do not extrapolate from related materials"
```

**Design Notes:**
- Three sections clearly separated
- Examples in quote boxes
- Warning icon for uncertainty handling

**Speaker Notes:**
> Assumptions - the hallucination prevention component. Without constraints, AI fills gaps with guesses. "If data is missing, mark Not Reported - do not estimate" prevents fabrication. "Exclude review papers" prevents mixing primary and secondary sources. "Focus exclusively on electrospinning" prevents irrelevant methods. This component protects scientific accuracy. Be explicit about what to include, what to exclude, and critically, how to handle uncertainty.

---

## SLIDE 19: T - Tone

**Visual:**
- Tone spectrum with examples
- Document type icons

**Content:**
```
T - Tone
Set voice and style

Scientific Tones:

Technical/Objective → For peer review, reports
Formal → For legal, regulatory documents
Conversational → For internal brainstorming
Cautious → For safety-critical procedures

Example Specification:
"Tone: Technical and objective, suitable for 
submission to Materials Science & Engineering: A. 
Avoid speculation or promotional language."
```

**Design Notes:**
- Horizontal spectrum showing tone range
- Document icons (legal doc, journal article, report)
- Example in highlighted box

**Speaker Notes:**
> Tone sets voice and style. "Technical and objective for journal submission" produces different language than "conversational for internal brainstorming." For patents: formal, precise. For lab documentation: clear, procedural. For management reports: business-focused. Tone prevents iteration to adjust style. If you need academic tone, specify it. If you need cautious language for safety, specify it. This component fine-tunes the last 10% of quality.

## SLIDE 20: Complete AUTOMAT Example

**Visual:**
- Full prompt displayed
- Each component highlighted in different color

**Content:**
```
[U] Act as Materials Science Patent Analyst with expertise in 
polymer composites and prior art searches.

[A] Audience: AmaDema IP Legal Team preparing patent application 
for novel PLA/graphene synthesis method.

[T] Extract information relevant to prior art assessment from 
these 12 papers on electrospinning-based PLA/graphene synthesis.

[O] Output: Markdown table - DOI, Year, Method, Graphene %, 
Key Innovation, Overlap (High/Medium/Low/None), Legal Notes

[M] Apply patent prior art search principles. Focus on claims 
challenging patentability. Highlight electrospinning + in-situ 
reduction methods.

[A] Constraints: Only peer-reviewed articles (no reviews/patents). 
If graphene % not specified, mark "NR". Flag papers from 
competitors (Nanotech Solutions, PolyMat GmbH). No speculation.

[T] Tone: Formal, objective, suitable for legal review. 
Err on caution when assessing overlap.
```

**Design Notes:**
- Each letter labeled [A], [U], [T], etc.
- Different color highlight for each component
- Clean, readable font

**Speaker Notes:**
> Here's a complete AUTOMAT prompt. Notice how every component is explicitly stated. This is for patent analysis - Audience is legal team (affects formality). User Persona is patent analyst (activates IP search knowledge). Task is explicit (extract information for prior art). Output specifies exact table structure. Method references patent principles. Assumptions constrain scope and prevent speculation. Tone is formal for legal context. This prompt gets first-shot, production-ready results. Without AUTOMAT, you'd iterate 5+ times to get this quality.

## SLIDE 21: AUTOMAT in Action - Live Demo

**Visual:**
- Screen capture placeholder
- Before/after comparison

**Content:**
```
Live Demonstration

Task: Extract synthesis parameters from 
materials science paper

Without AUTOMAT:
→ Vague request
→ Generic response
→ Multiple iterations needed

With AUTOMAT:
→ Complete specification
→ First-shot success
→ Production-ready output

[LIVE SANDBOX DEMO]
```

**Design Notes:**
- Large "LIVE DEMO" banner
- Timer icon (showing time savings)
- Placeholder for screen share

**Speaker Notes:**
> Let's see this in action. I'll show you the same task twice - once casual, once AUTOMAT. Watch the difference in iterations needed and output quality. [Conduct live demo in sandbox showing vague prompt requiring multiple iterations, then AUTOMAT prompt succeeding first shot]

**Interactive Element:**
> **Live Demo:** 
> 1. Show vague prompt: "Summarize synthesis parameters from this paper"
> 2. Show poor result requiring clarification
> 3. Show complete AUTOMAT prompt
> 4. Show first-shot success with production-ready table
> 5. Emphasize time difference (30 seconds vs 5 minutes)

## SLIDE 22: When to Use AUTOMAT

**Visual:**
- Decision flowchart
- Use case icons

**Content:**
```
AUTOMAT is Best For:

✓ Functional tasks with clear outputs
  (data extraction, formatting)

✓ Scientific workflows requiring precision

✓ Tasks where IP protection is critical

✓ Situations requiring reproducible results

Not Ideal For:

❌ Open-ended brainstorming

❌ Conversational learning (use CO-STAR - Day 2)

❌ Simple, one-sentence tasks
```

**Design Notes:**
- Two columns: Good for / Not for
- Green checkmarks and red X's
- Task icons

**Speaker Notes:**
> AUTOMAT excels at functional, structured tasks. Data extraction from papers? Perfect. Protocol formatting? Ideal. Patent analysis? Excellent. These are tasks with clear inputs and outputs where precision matters. Not ideal for brainstorming (too structured) or conversational learning (tomorrow's CO-STAR framework is better). Also overkill for "What's the melting point of PLA?" - simple questions don't need seven components. Use the right tool for the task.

## SLIDE 23: Section Title - Conversational Learning

**Visual:**
- Section divider with icon
- Conversation bubbles graphic

**Content:**
```
PART 3

Conversational Learning

From task executor to learning partner
```

**Design Notes:**
- Conversation bubbles in red and black
- Minimalist, clear divider

**Speaker Notes:**
> We've covered AUTOMAT for functional tasks. Now let's shift gears - using AI not just to complete tasks, but to build your expertise. This is about transforming how you interact with AI.

---

## SLIDE 24: The Mindset Shift

**Visual:**
- Two-path diagram showing different approaches
- Transformation arrow

**Content:**
```
Transactional ❌ → Learning Partnership ✅

Transactional:
"Summarize this paper" → [Copy summary] → Done
Result: Summary obtained, no learning

Learning Partnership:
"Summarize this paper" → [Read summary]
"Why did you structure it this way?"
"What criteria determined 'key findings'?"
"How would you adapt this for ceramic papers?"
Result: Summary + Methodology understanding

Same time, 5× learning
```

**Design Notes:**
- Left path (transactional) in gray, ending at dead end
- Right path (learning) in red, branching into multiple insights
- Comparison showing same time investment, different outcomes

**Speaker Notes:**
> Most people use AI transactionally - get answer, copy it, move on. No learning occurs. Learning partnership approach adds "why" questions. You invest same time but gain transferable understanding. The summary is a side effect; the methodology is the value. This compounds - today's learning applies to tomorrow's tasks. Transactional users need AI every time. Learning users become increasingly independent.

---

## SLIDE 25: The Power of "Why" Questions

**Visual:**
- Question hierarchy pyramid
- Examples at each level

**Content:**
```
Basic Learning Question Types:

1. Process Questions
   "How did you reach that conclusion?"
   "Walk me through your thinking"

2. Justification Questions
   "Why this approach over alternatives?"
   "What assumptions underlie your recommendation?"

3. Alternative Questions
   "What other approaches could work?"
   "How would this change in different contexts?"

Start simple, build depth progressively
```

**Design Notes:**
- Three tiers, progressively deeper
- Example questions in quote boxes
- Arrow showing progression from surface to depth

**Speaker Notes:**
> Three basic question types to start. Process questions reveal methodology. Justification questions expose assumptions. Alternative questions explore trade-offs. You don't need fancy techniques - just add one follow-up "why" to your normal AI interaction and you've started learning. "You recommended DMF - why?" reveals solvent selection criteria you can apply to future decisions. Small investment, large returns.

## SLIDE 26: Conversational Learning Example

**Visual:**
- Dialogue visualization
- Knowledge gained highlighted

**Content:**
```
Practical Example: Polymer Synthesis

Transactional (30 seconds):
User: "Best method to synthesize PLA?"
AI: "Ring-opening polymerization with tin catalysts"
User: "Thanks"
Knowledge gained: Zero

Learning Partnership (5 minutes):
User: "Best method to synthesize PLA?"
AI: "Ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of lactide..."
User: "Why ROP over direct polycondensation?"
AI: "ROP achieves higher Mw (100-300 kDa vs 10-30 kDa)..."
User: "What trade-offs exist? When would polycondensation be better?"
AI: "Polycondensation simpler and cheaper for lower Mw applications..."
User: "You mentioned tin catalysts. What alternatives and why aren't they standard?"
AI: "Al, Zn, Mg catalysts avoid tin toxicity concerns..."

Knowledge gained: Decision framework, trade-off understanding, transferable methodology
```

**Design Notes:**
- Two columns comparing approaches
- Highlighted "Knowledge gained" boxes
- Time noted for each

**Speaker Notes:**
> Same starting question, radically different outcomes. Transactional: 30 seconds, got a fact, zero learning. Learning partnership: 5 minutes, got the fact PLUS decision framework, trade-off understanding, catalyst selection criteria. That 5 minutes of investment pays dividends on every future synthesis decision. You're not just collecting answers; you're building expertise.

**Interactive Element:**
> **Think-Pair-Share:** "Think of one technical question you've asked AI recently. What follow-up 'why' question could you have asked?" (2 minutes discussion)

- Red warning banner at top
- Prohibition icons (red circle with slash) for each category
- Bold, attention-grabbing format

**Speaker Notes:**
> The Red List - non-negotiable. These data types NEVER go to ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or any public AI tool. Unpublished research loses patent priority if disclosed. Customer names violate NDAs. Exact formulations are trade secrets. Once shared with external AI, data may be stored, logged, or even used for training. For Red List items, use our local sandbox only - data never leaves the laptop. If you're unsure whether something is Red List, assume yes and ask IT.

## SLIDE 29: Hallucinations - What They Are

**Visual:**
- AI model making things up (illustration)
- Example fabrication

**Content:**
```
Understanding Hallucinations

What: AI generates plausible-sounding but 
factually incorrect information

Why They Occur:
LLMs are pattern-matching prediction engines, 
NOT knowledge databases

When you ask: "What is the tensile strength of 
Ti₆Al₄V at 400°C with 2% oxygen?"

AI doesn't:
❌ Look it up in database
❌ Calculate from first principles
❌ Admit uncertainty

AI does:
✅ Predict most probable tokens
✅ Synthesize plausible-sounding answer
✅ Present with confidence

→ Confidence ≠ Accuracy
```

**Design Notes:**
- Visual showing AI "guessing" with question marks
- Red warning icon for confidence issue
- Clear "doesn't/does" comparison

**Speaker Notes:**
> Hallucinations are AI's biggest risk for scientific work. AI doesn't "know" things - it predicts patterns. Asked for specific Ti alloy data at specific conditions, it doesn't look it up or calculate it. It generates plausible-sounding text based on training patterns. And critically, it presents guesses with confidence. Your job: verify everything. Especially citations, quantitative values, and specific claims. Never trust, always verify.

**Interactive Element:**
> **Poll:** "Has anyone encountered an AI hallucination in their work?" (Show of hands, brief discussion of examples)

## SLIDE 30: Preventing Hallucinations

**Visual:**
- Shield icon with strategies
- Before/after constraint examples

**Content:**
```
Hallucination Prevention Through Constraints

Without Constraints ❌:
"What is the melting point of this polymer?"
→ AI guesses if not in paper

With Constraints ✅:
"If melting point is reported in paper, extract it 
with page citation. If not reported, state 'Not Reported' 
- do not estimate."
→ AI admits ignorance instead of guessing

Key Strategies:
• Explicit uncertainty handling
• Require citations for claims
• Demand "Not Reported" over estimation
• Flag missing data, don't fill gaps
```

**Design Notes:**
- Side-by-side comparison
- Highlighted constraint language
- Red X and green checkmark

**Speaker Notes:**
> You prevent hallucinations through explicit constraints - the A component of AUTOMAT. "If data is missing, mark Not Reported - do not estimate" turns off guessing. "Cite page numbers for all claims" forces grounding in actual text. "If conflicting values, flag discrepancy" prevents AI from choosing arbitrarily. These constraints are your scientific rigor applied to AI. Don't let AI speculate; make it admit uncertainty.

## SLIDE 31: Verification Protocols

**Visual:**
- Checklist with verification steps
- Tool logos (CrossRef, Google Scholar)

**Content:**
```
Never Trust, Always Verify

Citation Verification:
☐ DOI resolves to real paper
☐ Authors match
☐ Journal and year correct
☐ Abstract aligns with claimed content
☐ Check actual data in paper

Quantitative Verification:
☐ Value within physically reasonable range
☐ Units are consistent
☐ Compare to known benchmarks
☐ Check against authoritative sources

Tools:
→ CrossRef DOI Search
→ Google Scholar
→ PubMed
→ Materials handbooks
→ Your domain expertise
```

**Design Notes:**
- Two checklists side by side
- Tool logos at bottom
- Professional, systematic layout

**Speaker Notes:**
> Verification is non-negotiable. For citations: verify DOI works, check authors match, read the abstract to confirm AI's claim aligns. For numbers: sanity check (PLA melting at 300°C? Impossible). Check units, compare to benchmarks. Use CrossRef for DOIs, Google Scholar for quick checks, your handbooks for reference values. Most importantly, apply your domain expertise. If it sounds wrong, it probably is. Trust but verify becomes: don't trust, always verify.

## SLIDE 32: Data Sanitization Strategies

**Visual:**
- Data transformation examples
- Before/after sanitization

**Content:**
```
Using AI Safely with Sensitive Data

Strategy 1: Anonymization
Replace specifics with placeholders

❌ Specific: "25kV, 15cm, 12% PLA (Mw 100kDa) 
in DMF:DCM (3:1), 5% graphene, 80°C, Yield: 87%"

✅ Sanitized: "[VOLTAGE], [DISTANCE], 
[CONCENTRATION]% polymer (Mw [VALUE]) 
in [SOLVENT], [X]% nanofiller, [TEMPERATURE], 
Yield: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]"

Strategy 2: Aggregation
Share trends, not specific values

❌ "Batch #343: 45.2 MPa at 23°C"
✅ "Strength decreases ~15% between 20-60°C"

Strategy 3: Hypothetical Framing
Ask about principles, not your specific case
```

**Design Notes:**
- Three strategies clearly separated
- Red X / Green checkmark comparisons
- Highlighted placeholders in brackets

**Speaker Notes:**
> You CAN use external AI for sensitive tasks if you sanitize first. Anonymization: replace exact values with [PLACEHOLDERS]. Now you can ask "format this generic protocol" without revealing your proprietary conditions. Aggregation: share trends not data points. Hypothetical framing: "For polymer nanocomposites generally, what affects dispersion?" instead of "For our PLA/graphene at these exact conditions..." Sanitization lets you leverage AI while protecting IP.

## SLIDE 35: Exercise 1 - AUTOMAT for Literature Review

**Visual:**
- Exercise icon with "1"
- Task description

**Content:**
```
Exercise 1: Build Your First AUTOMAT Prompt

Scenario:
You have 8 papers on electrospun PLA/graphene 
nanocomposites. Need to extract synthesis parameters 
for competitive analysis (quarterly R&D review).

Your Task:
Construct complete AUTOMAT prompt that:
• Extracts key synthesis parameters
• Outputs structured format for comparison
• Includes constraints for consistency
• Handles missing data appropriately

Time: 15 minutes
Location: Use sandbox at http://[IP]:3000
```

**Design Notes:**
- Clear scenario box
- Task checklist
- Time and location prominent
- Exercise number in red circle

**Speaker Notes:**
> First exercise: build your own AUTOMAT prompt. Scenario is literature review for competitive analysis - realistic R&D task. You need to extract synthesis parameters, specify output format, add constraints. Refer to your cheat sheet (website has it). Work individually first, then we'll review examples together. If you get stuck, raise your hand. Focus on being explicit in each component - that's the skill we're building.

**Interactive Element:**
> Walk around, provide individual guidance, note common mistakes for group debrief

## SLIDE 36: Exercise 1 - Debrief

**Visual:**
- Example solution displayed
- Common mistakes highlighted

**Content:**
```
Exercise 1: What We Learned

Common Mistakes:
❌ Vague Task: "Extract info from papers"
✅ Specific: "Extract synthesis temp, voltage, 
   graphene %, yield from Methods sections"

❌ Undefined Output: "Make it a table"
✅ Specific: "Markdown table with columns: 
   [DOI, Method, Temp (°C), Voltage (kV)...]"

❌ No Constraints: AI guesses when data missing
✅ Explicit: "If parameter not reported, mark 'NR'"

Key Takeaway:
Specificity eliminates iterations
```

**Design Notes:**
- Red X / Green checkmark comparisons
- Highlighted example solution
- Key takeaway in box

**Speaker Notes:**
> Let's debrief. Common mistakes: vague tasks, undefined outputs, missing constraints. Look at the difference between "extract info" and "extract synthesis temperature, voltage, graphene percentage from Methods sections only." The specific version eliminates guessing. Same with output - "make it a table" leaves format ambiguous. "Markdown table with these exact columns" is actionable. Anyone want to share their prompt? [Invite volunteers to share, provide constructive feedback]

**Interactive Element:**
> **Volunteer Share:** "Who wants to share their prompt with the group?" (2-3 volunteers, provide feedback, highlight good practices)

5 deliberate errors:
• 1 fabricated citation
• 1 physically impossible value
• 1 misattributed discovery
• 1 inconsistent claim
• 1 non-existent characterization technique

Your Task:
1. Read report (on website)
2. Identify all 5 errors
3. Explain why each is wrong
4. Suggest verification method

Time: 20 minutes
Prize: "Critical Thinker" badge for fastest team
```

**Design Notes:**

**Content:**
```
Hallucination Hunt: Answers

Error 1: Fabricated Citation
Zhang et al. (2023), DOI: 10.1002/pen.2023.08.445
→ DOI format wrong, doesn't resolve
→ Verify: CrossRef search

Error 2: Physically Impossible
Simultaneous modulus AND ductility increase
→ Typically trade-off (stiffness ↔ flexibility)
→ Verify: Materials science principles

Error 3: Non-existent Technique
"Quantum-resolution XPS"
→ No such characterization method exists
→ Verify: Domain knowledge

[Continue for all 5...]
```

**Design Notes:**
- Each error revealed separately
- Verification method for each
- Red highlight on errors

**Speaker Notes:**
> Let's reveal the errors. Error 1: fabricated citation. DOI format is wrong (2023.08.445 isn't valid format). Try it in CrossRef - doesn't exist. This is a common hallucination - realistic-looking but fake citation. Error 2: simultaneous modulus and ductility increase. Your materials science knowledge should flag this - typically a trade-off. Possible but unusual, requires verification. Error 3: "quantum-resolution XPS" - no such technique. AI invented it combining "quantum" (sounds scientific) with XPS (real technique). Your domain knowledge catches this immediately. [Continue through all 5]

- Traffic light system (red/yellow/green)
- Scenario cards

**Content:**
```
Exercise 3: IP Protection Practice

For each scenario, determine:
✅ Green: Safe for external AI
⚠️ Yellow: Safe after sanitization
🚫 Red: Local sandbox only

Scenarios:
A. Format lab notebook (exact synthesis conditions, 
   patent-pending process)
B. Summarize 6 published papers (DOIs provided)
C. Analyze SEM image (from proprietary experiment)
D. Generate Python code (generic, no data attached)
E. Draft customer email (names company, revenue %)

Time: 10 minutes
```

**Design Notes:**
- Traffic light icons prominent
- Scenarios in separate cards
- Color-coded for quick reference

**Speaker Notes:**
> Red List practice. Five scenarios, three levels of risk. Green: safe for ChatGPT/Claude. Yellow: sanitize first, then safe. Red: local sandbox only. Read each carefully - details matter. "Published papers" = green (public data). "Exact synthesis conditions for patent-pending process" = red (unpublished IP). "Customer names and revenue %" = red (confidential). Think through each scenario, apply Red List principles. This becomes second nature with practice.

## SLIDE 40: Exercise 3 - Debrief & Answers

**Visual:**
- Answers revealed with explanations
- Decision framework

**Content:**
```
Red List Assessment: Answers

Scenario A: 🚫 RED
Patent-pending = unpublished IP
→ Local sandbox only

Scenario B: ✅ GREEN
Published papers = public data
→ Any tool fine

Scenario C: 🚫 RED
Proprietary experiment = Red List
→ Local sandbox OR sanitize image (remove metadata)

Scenario D: ✅ GREEN
Generic code request, no data = public info
→ Any tool fine

Scenario E: 🚫 RED
Customer name + revenue = confidential
→ Local sandbox OR sanitize (remove names/numbers)
```

**Design Notes:**
- Each answer with color-coded icon
- Reasoning provided
- Sanitization options noted

**Speaker Notes:**
> Answers: A is red - patent-pending means unpublished, never external AI. B is green - published papers are public, no issue. C is red unless sanitized - proprietary image is Red List, but you could strip metadata and sanitize. D is green - generic code request with no attached data is fine. E is red unless sanitized - customer names and revenue percentages are confidential. Remove specifics, ask hypothetically instead. The pattern: published/public = green, unpublished/confidential = red, unless you can sanitize to remove sensitive details.
